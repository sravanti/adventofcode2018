# Advent of Code 2018 Solutions using Go

Still relatively new to Go, so I'm getting a grasp for the fundamentals through these challenges. It's very likely I didn't implement something in the idiomatic Go fashion. Please call me out on this! I'd love to learn :) Open an issue, PR, tweet me @sravanti__, whatever works. If you have any questions about my solutions, please let me know.
